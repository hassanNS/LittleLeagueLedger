Little League Ledger helps you manager small community soccer leagues by
giving you a simple interface and only much needed features.
No clutter. Only what you need to keep track of your teams, players, and
statistics.

You ain't running the EPL obviously. You just want something that works and
not so annoying to learn!

PS: CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT!
